# Welcome to Your Blog Post

This is a template for creating new blog posts using MDX. MDX allows you to write JSX in your Markdown documents, making it easy to create interactive and engaging content.

## What is MDX?

MDX is a format that lets you seamlessly write JSX in your Markdown documents. You can import components, such as interactive charts or alerts, and embed them within your content.

## Basic Markdown Syntax

### Headings

You can create headings using the `#` symbol. The more `#` symbols you use, the smaller the heading.

### Text Formatting

You can make text **bold** using double asterisks, or *italic* using single asterisks. You can also use ~~strikethrough~~ with double tildes.

### Lists

Unordered lists:
- First item
- Second item
- Third item

Ordered lists:
1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

### Links and Images

You can add links like this: [Visit our website](https://example.com)

Images can be added like this:

![Alt text for image](/images/blog/example.jpg)

### Code Blocks

Inline code: `const greeting = "Hello World"`

Code blocks with syntax highlighting:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
  return `Welcome to our blog, ${name}`;
}

greet("Reader");
```

```typescript
interface BlogPost {
  title: string;
  date: string;
  author: string;
  tags: string[];
}

const post: BlogPost = {
  title: "My First Blog",
  date: "2026-01-21",
  author: "John Doe",
  tags: ["nextjs", "mdx"]
};
```

### Blockquotes

> This is a blockquote. It's great for highlighting important information or quotes from other sources.
>
> You can have multiple paragraphs in a blockquote.

### Tables

| Feature | Description | Status |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| MDX Support | Write JSX in Markdown | ✅ Enabled |
| Syntax Highlighting | Beautiful code blocks | ✅ Enabled |
| Fast Performance | Server-side rendering | ✅ Enabled |

## Advanced MDX Features

MDX allows you to do more than just Markdown. You can:

1. **Import React components** - Use custom components in your blog posts
2. **Use JSX** - Add interactive elements directly in your content
3. **Frontmatter** - Metadata at the top of your file for SEO and organization

## Best Practices

When creating a new blog post:

1. **Choose a descriptive filename** - Use kebab-case (e.g., `my-awesome-post.mdx`)
2. **Fill in all frontmatter fields** - This helps with SEO and organization
3. **Use descriptive headings** - Make your content easy to scan
4. **Add alt text to images** - Improve accessibility
5. **Keep paragraphs short** - Improve readability
6. **Use code blocks for code** - Make technical content clear

## Conclusion

You're now ready to create your first blog post! Copy this template, rename it, and start writing your content. Happy blogging!
